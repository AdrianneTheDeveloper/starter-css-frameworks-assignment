# CSS Frameworks: Assignment

## Instructions

To complete this assignment, you will need to build a website that looks similar to the one shown below. Your website _must_ conform to the following constraints:

- It must 100% rely on Twitter Bootstrap. You may have _no_ custom CSS.
- It should have a similar layout and color scheme to the example below.
- It should be responsive, as show below.

Your website does _not_ need to have the exact same content. You will be graded based off of your ability to recreate the layout, not the exact text.
If you would like to use the same content - here is a reference [link](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/group/bears-grizzly-polar-panda/) . (Source: National Geographic. (2019, July 26). Bears)
